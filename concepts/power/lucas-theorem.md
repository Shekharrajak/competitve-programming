If MOD is a prime number, and N has base MOD representation (aj,...,a1,a0) and r has base MOD representation (bj,...,b1,b0), then (N CHOOSE R) is congruent [mod MOD] to

(N choose R) modulus MOD = ((aj CHOOSE bj)...(a1 CHOOSE b1) (a0 CHOOSE b0)) modulus MOD

Let me make it more clear with example, for instance you have answer as (588 choose 277) % 5, then
